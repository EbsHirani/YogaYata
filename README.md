# YogaYata
A yoga app that uses AI to correct poses and uses AR to visualize difficult poses with curated workout routines as well as options to create custom routines

Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines that originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six Ä€stika (orthodox) schools of Indian philosophical traditions. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goal in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The term "Yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise, consisting largely of postures or asanas.
